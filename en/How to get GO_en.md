## How to get GO? ##

Players on the TRON Go platform can get GO in four ways:

**1.Betting with TRX on TRON Go's games to win GO as mining rewards:**

TRON Go plans to put 60% of the total supply (6 billion GO) into the mining pool. In the mining pool, GO can only be issued as Token reward when users bet with TRX in the game. And there is no other consumption scenario of GO to ensure funds security in the mining pool. 
We also expect to design more Token recycling and consumption scenarios, and we will re-transfer the recycled GO into the mining pool regularly according to the opinions of the community and the state of the platform.

The platform adopts the form of betting with TRX to winning GO reward. Any player in all games of our platform (include Lucky Slot) can get GO rewards after they participate in the game with TRX. The amount of rewarded GO is related to the progress of Token distribution and the bet amount of TRX.

Bet is mining, which means that you can get GO by betting TRX. In different period, you will get different amount of TRX as follows:

The earlier a player enters the game, the more GO they will get. Tron Go will carry out the mechanism of “TRX consumption - Mining - Token consumption - Token recycling” to maintain permanent mining.

**2.Invite friends to participate in the game and get referal rewards:**

Refer a friend to earn an addition award of 10% of GO he mined. And you need to play Lucky Slot with TRX at least once to get rewards from your invitees.

**3.Complete Daliy Tasks:**

We have prepared daily tasks with generous rewards, and players will win TRX or GO if they complete the mission.

**4.Participate in community airdrop activities**

We will launch airdrop activities in the community at any time to reward the supports of loyal players, please keep an eye on us!
